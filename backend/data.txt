From the ultra clever, future-proofed layout and space-saving furniture to the incredible green-wall, exquisite reclaimed timbers and green-roof features, this truly is a dream tiny house. \n\nIt’s hard to believe that it’s now been almost seven years since we filmed our very first tiny house tour with Shaye. At the time, she was living in Lucy, a cute DIY cottage-style tiny house. You can see a link to our first tour here: https://youtu.be/f3SwqNzsNwg\n\nSince then, life has changed a lot and Shaye has started a tiny house building company. Years of tiny house design experience and over 30 tiny house builds later, this home is a conjunction of many of her favourite design concepts. \n\nEnjoy the full tour of this incredible tiny home.
